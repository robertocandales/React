      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p className='sangria'>
        I am a self-motivated individual who thrives on succeeding in challenging situations. I am
        passionate about Professional development opportunities and welcome every opportunity to
        take my capabilities to a higher level. <br />
        <br />
        I am suitably qualified with a degree in Electrical Engineering, relevant experience and the
        skillset required to make a positive and valuable contribution to your company. I am a
        front-end developer who has a wide range of front end skills, mainly with javascript
        language stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS/Redux, React Natice, Node.js, Express,
        API-Rest) <br />
        <br />
        I really enjoy writing optimised object code and am very good at building and maintaining
        applications that support the solutions delivered to both internal and external customers. I
        always look to add my own magical touch to any new code that I write,and would like to
        mention that I love learning and continually expanding my knowledge stack and I think that
        is my main skill. <br />
        <br />I consider myself a real team player who understands the importance of teamwork,
        collaboration, and open communication. In addition to this I am not only commercially aware,
        proactive, adaptable and flexible, but also able to work in an environment which changes at
        a fast pace.
